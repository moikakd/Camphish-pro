# 🛡️ SECURITY POLICY - NEURAL NODE PROTECTION

At **CIPHER ELITE RESEARCH LABS**, we believe that even a tool designed for exfiltration research must maintain the highest standards of internal security and responsible disclosure. This document outlines our protocol for reporting vulnerabilities and our commitment to architectural integrity.

## 🧬 SUPPORTED VERSIONS

Currently, only the **Zenith (v10.0)** branch is actively receiving security patches and neural updates.

| VERSION | STATUS | SECURITY SUPPORT |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **v10.0 [ZENITH]** | `ACTIVE` | ✅ FULL SUPPORT |
| **v8.x - v9.x** | `DEPRECATED` | ❌ NO SUPPORT |
| **v1.x - v7.x** | `LEGACY` | ❌ NO SUPPORT |

## 🛰️ VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE PROTOCOL

If you discover a security vulnerability within the **CIPHER-CAMPHISH-PRO** framework, we request that you initiate a **Private Handshake** rather than publicizing the issue. Public disclosure of vulnerabilities can compromise active research nodes.

### 📥 HOW TO REPORT
To report a vulnerability, please contact the **Architect** through the following encrypted-style channels:

*   **Telegram (Encrypted):** [t.me/cipher_attacks](https://t.me/cipher_attacks)
*   **GitHub Issues:** *Only for feature requests and bugs.* For security flaws, use the private channel above.

Please include the following in your report:
1.  **Module Affected:** (e.g., Exfiltration Hub, Neural Dispatcher).
2.  **Payload Type:** Proof of Concept (PoC) code.
3.  **Impact Analysis:** How this vulnerability could be exploited by unauthorized actors.

---

## 🛡️ OUR COMMITMENT (RESPONSE TIMELINE)

Once a valid vulnerability report is received, the **CIPHER** node will:
1.  **Acknowledge Handshake:** Within 24-48 hours.
2.  **Neural Patching:** A fix will be developed and pushed to the `main` branch as a priority.
3.  **Credit:** Security researchers who report critical flaws in good faith will be credited in the next Release Notes.

---

## ⚖️ ETHICAL CONDUCT & SAFE HARBOR

This framework is a **Sovereign-Grade Research Tool**. We strongly advocate for "Ethical Hacking" and authorized testing. 

*   **Good Faith:** Any research performed on this tool to harden its defenses is encouraged. 
*   **Authorized Use Only:** We do not condone the use of our logic for malicious purposes. The user is solely responsible for their actions.

## 👤 THE ARCHITECT'S VISION

> "Security is not a static state; it is an evolving interaction between logic and defense. We build to understand, and we understand to protect."
